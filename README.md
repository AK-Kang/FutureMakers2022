# FutureMakers2022

7/6
The MIT FutureMakers Create-a-thon program started today, and I was really happy to meet so many different people coming from various backgrounds. Today we had a quick review of Google Colab and Python programming. I looked forward to the actual implementations of Machine Learning and building apps using ML techniques to further societal developments.

Today I learned more about different types of learing: supervised, unsupervised, semi-supervised, and reinforcement. It was interesting knowing more about different types of learning and their models. I also attended a seminar hosted by Mrs. Salila Yohn and discussed ethics regarding working in tech.
