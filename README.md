# FutureMakers2022

##7/6
The MIT FutureMakers Create-a-thon program started today, and I was really happy to meet so many different people coming from various backgrounds. Today we had a quick review of Google Colab and Python programming. I looked forward to the actual implementations of Machine Learning and building apps using ML techniques to further societal developments.
