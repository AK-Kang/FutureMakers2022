# FutureMakers2022

7/6
The MIT FutureMakers Create-a-thon program started today, and I was really happy to meet so many different people coming from various backgrounds. Today we had a quick review of Google Colab and Python programming. I looked forward to the actual implementations of Machine Learning and building apps using ML techniques to further societal developments.  

7/7
Today I learned more about different types of learning: supervised, unsupervised, semi-supervised, and reinforcement. It was interesting knowing more about different types of learning and their models. I also attended a seminar hosted by Mrs. Salila Yohn and discussed ethics regarding working in tech. I understood more about equality and equity and how to be as non-biased as one could in the workplace.

7/8
I learned about different runtime GPU, TPU, and CPU and when to use each. This was interesting since it could greatly improve the codes' runtime efficiency. I also learned a lot more about machine learning models. I need to look at each of them and analyze them more closely so that I know when to use which.

7/11
I learned about leadership and how to write engaging stories using elements of self, us, and now.
