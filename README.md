# FutureMakers2022

7/6
The MIT FutureMakers Create-a-thon program started today, and I was really happy to meet so many different people coming from various backgrounds. Today we had a quick review of Google Colab and Python programming. I looked forward to the actual implementations of Machine Learning and building apps using ML techniques to further societal developments.  

7/7
Today I learned more about different types of learning: supervised, unsupervised, semi-supervised, and reinforcement. It was interesting knowing more about different types of learning and their models. I also attended a seminar hosted by Mrs. Salila Yohn and discussed ethics regarding working in tech. I understood more about equality and equity and how to be as non-biased as one could in the workplace.

7/8
I learned about different runtime GPU, TPU, and CPU and when to use each. This was interesting since it could greatly improve the codes' runtime efficiency. I also learned a lot more about machine learning models. I need to look at each of them and analyze them more closely so that I know when to use which.

7/11
I learned about leadership and how to write engaging stories using elements of self, us, and now.

7/12
Today, I learned about tensors and different packages for machine learning: Tensorflow, Keras, and Pytorch. I learned the difference between these different packages and when to use which.

7/13
I learned about forward pass and backward pass. I also learned about how to combine features with weights and biases together to make predictions. 

7/14
Today we learned about the basic structure of a convolutional neural network. A CNN is usually composed of a convolution layer, activation layer, pooling layer, and a fully connected layer. We also learned about different filters/kernels.

7/15
Today I learned about different types of biases in machine learning models and how to try our best to decrease biases in various ways.

7/18
I learned about 3 parameters (depths, padding, and stride) that determine the size of the feature maps. I also learned more about the practices of Data Science in the real world.

7/19
I learned about the difference between classification and regression. I also learned that loss function is generally used to show the accuracy of a model. I learned about different aspects that compose a loss function, including learning rate and the gradient descent.
